## In Progress

- I2C communications between modules
- DSP units running on the second core (stateful processes, e.g. stochastic generators, input filtering)
- Midi In / Out via the editor
- Output expander board with 8 analog outs
- Express numbers and calculations in real units in ModuLISP (volts, seconds etc)
- Editor bug fixes (colour scheming, issues with undo)

## Future Plans

- Open Sound Control via the editor
- Upgrade to the new RP2350 chip (faster DSP)
- Input expander board (more knobs, buttons, switches, analog and pulse inputs)
